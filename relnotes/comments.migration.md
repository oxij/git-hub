### Use `#-#` for comments instead of `#`

The symbol `#` at the start of a line is a header tag in Markdown and `#-#`should be used instead for comments. The syntax of the new comment header does not look esthetically good and it is not intended for practical use but it will avoid mangling markdown or any other markup language.
If you have any script that creates new issues, PRs or comments then they will need to be updated to the new comment header.
